# Apache + PHP 8.1 + MariaDB

This is a simple Apache image that can be used to serve PHP content.

I'm assuming that your php files are in a folder named `app` you can change this in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Usage

Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to your project and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
