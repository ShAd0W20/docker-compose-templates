# Templates for docker compose

I have put together some examples of docker compose files for different services such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, NodeJS, etc.

You can find each file inside the folders specified by its name

## Notes

- The files are not intended to be used in production, they are just examples of how to use docker compose to run a service
- I'm not a docker expert, so if you find any error or have any suggestion, please let me know and I'll fix it as soon as possible
- I'm assuming you have docker and docker-compose installed in your machine and that you know how to use them (if not, please check the official documentation)
- If you want to contribute, see the section below
